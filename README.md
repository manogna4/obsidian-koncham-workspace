# koncham workspace

an obsidian plugin to enhance the workspace

## features

### `Center panes` tab on sidebar (vertical tabs)

This is a tab on the left side-bar that lists all the panes open in the main area.

This works a little like vertical tabs (in vivaldi and edge browsers)

It is useful when using obsidian in ways that some open panes are hidden from view.

examples of such modes include:
+ sliding-panes
+ maximize active pane

This screen recording shows maximized notes:

### pin/unpin panes

Pinning all panes forces every new note to open in it's own pane.
When some external applications open a note in Obsidian, they switch away from the last active un-pinned pane. Pinning prevents losing your existing open notes.

## features planned

+ more functionality in `center panes` view through right click
+ pane switcher
+ pane arrangements such as (1+1), (1+2) using commands
+ rearrange panes in alphabetical order
